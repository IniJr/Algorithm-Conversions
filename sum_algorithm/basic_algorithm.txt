- read the 18 numbers from where they are stored and put them in an array
- Naturally, each number in the array is indexed 
- Take the first number at the zero index, and add the next number to it (the one at the 1 index ) 
- Get the sum
- loop through the array , adding the number at the next index position to the new sum 
- Get the new sumâ€¦loop through again in the same way through each number in the array 
- After the number at the 17th index is added, end the loop 
- print the final sum
